    - SAMS Chap04 & Chap05
    - DMMT Chap02

Prog04: JavaScript Events
    - Event-driven programming is a key paradigm in web development, enabling 
    dynamic and interactive user experiences based on user interactions with a 
    webpage.

    - Create a html file called 'prog04.html' that contains three black buttons 
    labeled in white as RED, GREEN, and BLUE.

    - Add an event to each button that changes the background color of the 
    window to the corresponding color when clicked.

    - Display a counter for each color showing the number of times that color 
    has been displayed (e.g., "RED count:").

    - Implement a hover effect: When the mouse passes over a button, reverse the
     colors of the button and the label. Return to the original colors when the 
     mouse leaves. Display a counter showing the number of times each button has
    changed colors.

Prog05: PHP Hello World
    - Full-stack development brings together both front-end and back-end 
    development. You have been introduced to the front-end through HTML, CSS and
     Javascript. The purpose of this assignment is to get you started learning a
    back-end development scripting language known as PHP.

    - Create a 'helloworld.php' and run it on your server

    - upload a video demonstrating that the script is properly running

Group02: More CSS
    - Students will delve into concepts such as the box model, icons, lists, 
    tables, responsive tables, website layout components (header, nav bar, 
    content, footer), image gallery, and float property. After understanding 
    these elements, students will collaborate to create a sample web page 
    showcasing each of these items.

    - Create a 'Group02CSS.html' that demonstrates all of the new elements 
    learned

Title: Getting Started with Dynamic Websites

Prog06: Moving Buttons
    - The purpose of this assignment is to provide students with hands-on 
    experience in creating interactive web elements using HTML, CSS, and 
    JavaScript. By developing a dynamic webpage that allows users to generate 
    colored buttons, change button colors, calculate running totals, and 
    implement button movement with timer events, students will enhance their 
    understanding of event handling and manipulation in web application 
    development.

Assignment: Main Page
    - Make sure your domain is setup such that whenever someone goes to your 
    domain (whatever.com) you display your main page which should be a nice 
    intro with navigation bar which will take you to any of your assignments. 
    Organize them whoever you think best.
