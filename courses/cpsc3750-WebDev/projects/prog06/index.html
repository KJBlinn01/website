    <ol>
        <li>Create a webpage named `ButtonMove.html` along with associated CSS and JavaScript files.</li>
        <li>Upload the files to your hosted website for accessibility.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Include a list and a button at the top of the page.</li>
                <li>Create a viewing area (rectangle) that occupies approximately 3/4 of the browser window, colored black.</li>
                <li>Develop a dropdown list of colors (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, White).</li>
                <li>Add a button labeled "Make Button" that generates a colored button of the selected color at a random location within the viewing area with a label of a random integer.</li>
                <li> Ensure that the generated button stays completely within the viewing area to adjust random locations accordingly.</li>
                <li>When a colored button is clicked, change its color to the currently selected color from the color list.</li>
            </ul>

        </li>
        <li> **Grade B Features (in addition to Grade C):**
            <ul>
                <li> Display a running total of the sum of all clicked buttons using the random number as the button text. Place this total with an appropriate label near the other controls.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li> **Grade A Features (in addition to Grade B):**

                <li>Implement timer events to make the buttons move around the viewing area in random directions.</li>
                <li> Buttons should change direction upon reaching the edge of the viewing area.</li>
                <li> Add a button labeled "MOVE" at the top to initiate button movement for all buttons. Change the button text to "PAUSE" to halt movement when pressed again.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li> Ensure the inclusion of a navigation bar for easy access to different sections of the webpage.</li>
