        <h1>Programming Exam #2</h1>
        <p>
            Given a word.txt file, determine how many vowels (A,E,I,O,U) are in
            each word and associate each word with the number of vowels.
            After finding the amount of vowels in each word, display buttons
            for the user to select how many vowels they want to see in the words.
            Whenever the user presses one of these buttons, display all of the 
            words that have that many vowels in a scrollable list. The user can
            then drag and drop the words they want to keep into a drop area.
        </p>
        <h2>REQUIREMENTS FOR A:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The scrollable list should be sorted in word length order from shortest word to longest word.</li>
            <li>Display the words and allow the user to drag a word from the list and drop it in an area of your choosing.</li>
        </ul>
