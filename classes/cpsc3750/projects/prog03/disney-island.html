                <p>My love for Disney started when I was a child. I remember 
                    watching all the classic Disney movies with my family and 
                    friends. I was always fascinated by the magic and wonder 
                    that Disney brought to the screen and also to their parks. 
                    I would often travel to the parks as new and innovative 
                    rides would come out. I one day dream I can work for the 
                    Walt Disney Company and bring the magic to others.

                <h3>My First Disney Trip:</h3>
                <p>My family took a Disney trip when I was about 6 years old
                    and I feel in love with the company. I always admired the 
                    characters and the stories that Disney created. I remember
                    meeting Pluto for the first time and I was so excited as 
                    he was my favorite character growing up. I would often dress 
                    up as Disney characters for Halloween.

                <p>Star Wars is a franchise that I have always loved. I remember 
                    watching the original trilogy with my dad and being amazed 
                    by the story and the characters. I have always been a fan of 
                    the Sith and the epic battles that they have with the rebels. 
                    This photo is from the first time I visited Galaxy's Edge 
                    at Disney World and experience the magic of Star Wars in 
                    person.</p>

                <br>

                <h3>Favorite Star Wars Movie:</h3>
                <p>My favorite Star Wars movie is "Revenge of the Sith". I love 
                    the story of Anakin Skywalker and how he becomes Darth Vader. 
                    I believe Darth Vader is the best villain that was ever 
                    created in cinema! I also love the music and the visuals 
                    in this movie. It is a true masterpiece of cinema.
